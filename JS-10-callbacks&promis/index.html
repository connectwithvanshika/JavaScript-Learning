    <h1>Callbacks and Promises in JS/Asynchronous behaviour of JS</h1>


    <p><strong>Callbacks:</strong> Functions passed as arguments to other functions, executed once the task is complete.</p>

    <p><strong>Promises:</strong> Objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation.</p>

    <p><strong>Synchronous:</strong> Code executed in sequence, blocking the next task until the current one finishes.Solution to callback hell is promises</p>

    <p><strong>Asynchronous:</strong> Code that allows the next task to run while waiting for another task to finish (non-blocking).</p>
